    "The project aims to provide data-driven insights to support Microsoft's new movie studio in establishing a successful presence in the movie industry. The goal is to help Microsoft's new movie studio understand what kinds of movies are currently popular at the box office. We'll look at things like the types of movies people are watching the most, who is watching them, and how much money they're making. By doing this research, we aim to give the studio useful information that they can use to decide what kind of movies to make. This means figuring out which genres and themes are likely to attract the most viewers and make the most money. Ultimately, our objective is to give Microsoft's movie studio the insights they need to create successful movies that people will enjoy watching.\"\n",
